> ## LINUX

  Hey Guys!! ,
  In this blog i will share my experience concern Linux. You may often heard of Linux, What actually Linux is.
  Linux is an open source Unix-like operating system based on linux kernal, Linux first released in 1991, by Linux Torvalds.
  It's completely open source you simply can download and install Linux operating system on your machine .[Linux](https://www.linux.org). Linux have it's own graphical user interface to interact with your machine through graphical icons, instead of text navigation.


 > ## TERMINAL

  Terminal or Terminal Emulator is a program that allow the use of the terminal in a graphical environment. As most people use an Operating System
  with a graphical user interface (UI). So hope you understand what indeed Terminal is we can use terminal to execute command line. In windows if
  we want to delete or create an file we simply right click mouse and choose the required option that is quite embarassing, but in Linux we have Terminal we can use commands
  to execute file system and do changes from that Terminal only.
  This is how Terminal looks like

 You can simply open Terminal by pressing 'ctrl+Alt+t' key and start using command lines, Linux Terminal is very powerfull a wrong command may crash your files and data so beware of that.

 > ## SHELL

 When using a graphical user interface (GUI), we need another program
called a terminal emulator to interact with the shell. If we look through our
desktop menus, we will probably find one. KDE uses konsole, and GNOME
uses gnome-terminal, though it’s likely called simply Terminal on your menu.
A number of other terminal emulators are available for Linux, but they all
basically do the same thing: give us access to the shell. You will probably
develop a preference for one or another terminal emulator based on the
number of bells and whistles it has. the terminal is a program that draws text into your windows, and let's you type things in on a keyboard
technically it is terminal. but the terminal itself doesn't know what to do with that
input it needs another program to do that, in this case that program is the shell.
Terminal send message to the program (shell) what input is given to Terminal than Shell as a program execute what command to be run .

So let’s get started. Launch the terminal emulator. Once it comes up, we
should see something like this: ([me@linuxbox ~]$)
This is called a shell prompt, and it will appear whenever the shell is
ready to accept input. While it might vary in appearance somewhat depend-
ing on the distribution, it will typically include your username@machinename,
followed by the current working directory (more about that in a little bit)
and a dollar sign.
If the last character of the prompt is a hash mark ( # ) rather than a
dollar sign, the terminal session has superuser privileges. This means either
we are logged in as the root user or we selected a terminal emulator that
provides superuser (administrative) privileges.

A Few Words About Mice and Focus

while the shell is all about the keyboard, you can also use a mouse with your
terminal emulator. A mechanism built into the X Window System (the underly-
ing engine that makes the GUI go) supports a quick copy-and-paste technique.
If you highlight some text by holding down the left mouse button and dragging
the mouse over it (or double-clicking a word), it is copied into a buffer main-
tained by X. Pressing the middle mouse button will cause the text to be pasted
at the cursor location. Try it.
Don’t be tempted to use ctrl -C and ctrl -V to perform copy and paste
inside a terminal window. They don’t work. These control codes have different
meanings to the shell and were assigned many years before the release of
Microsoft Windows.
Your graphical desktop environment (most likely KDE or GNOME), in an
effort to behave like Windows, probably has its focus policy set to “click to
focus.” This means for a window to get focus (become active), you need to
click on itA shell program. This is contrary to the traditional X behavior of “focus follows
mouse,” which means that a window gets focus just by passing the mouse
over it. The window will not come to the foreground until you click on it,
but it will be able to receive input. Setting the focus policy to “focus follows
mouse” will make the copy-and-paste technique even more useful. Give it a
try if you can (some desktop environments such as Ubuntu’s Unity no longer
support it). I think if you give it a chance, you will prefer it. You will find this
setting in the configuration program for your window manager.

> ## BASH


So our next topic is Bash, What is bash ?
Bash is a shell program.
A shell program is typically an executable binary that takes commands that you type and (once you hit return), translates those commands into (ultimately) system calls to the Operating System API.


> ## LINUX COMMAND LINE


When we speak of the command line, we
are really referring to the shell. Linux commands are quite easy to execute the first thing we need to learn is
how to navigate the file system on our Linux system.

**pwd** - print working directory
**cd** - change directory
**ls** - list diectory

**MANIPULATING FILES AND DIRECTORIES**


**mkdir**  Create directories
**rm**  Remove files and directories
**ln**  Create hard and symbolic links
**cp**  Copy files and directories
**mv**  Move/rename files and directories

Now, to be frank, some of the tasks performed by these commands are
more easily done with a graphical file manager. With a file manager, we
can drag and drop a file from one directory to another, cut and paste files,
delete files, and so on. So why use these old command line programs?
