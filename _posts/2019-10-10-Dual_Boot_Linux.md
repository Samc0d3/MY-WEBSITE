> ## My transition from windows to linux and dual boot.

I'm gonna share my experience with dual boot, well i guess souds really cool.
Ok so what the heck DUAL BOOT is ? well DUAL BOOT is a process to use two OPERATING SYSTEMS in one COMPUTER.

The Operating Systems I'm gonna install are LINUX and WINDOWS.
1. UBUNTU :- Ubuntu is a free and open-source Linux distribution based on Debian.

This is how UBUNTU looks like.
2. WINDOWS :- Well as most of you folks have a slight idea about windows so yeah let's go further.

3. Making a Bootable PENDRIVE or DVD whatever you prefer.
IN WINDOWS :- Here we create bootable pendrive from RUFUS (A software used to create bootable medium).
Rufus is a free and open-source portable application for Microsoft Windows that can be used to format and create bootable USB flash drives or Live USBs.

IN UBUNTU :- Now i will show you how can you make bootable pendrive in UBUNTU.
We're going to use an application called 'startup Disk Creator' to write the ISO image to your USB stick.
This is installed by default on Ubuntu, and can be launched simply by searching it.

When launched, Startup Disk Creator will look for the ISO files in your Downloads folder, as well as any attached USB storage it can write to.
It's likely that both your Ubuntu ISO and the correct USB device will have been detected and set as ‘Source disc image' and ‘Disk to use' in the application window. If not, use the ‘Other' button to locate your ISO file and select the exact USB device you want to use from the list of devices.
Click Make Startup Disk to start the process.

That's it! You now have Ubuntu on your USB drive, bootable and ready to go.

3. Let's install the OS and make it DUAL BOOT, i'm assuming you have already installed one OS(OPERATING SYSTEM) Either LINUX or WINDOWS.
4. Now we have dual boot our OS and this is how it looks like and we can use any one of the two OS's.
