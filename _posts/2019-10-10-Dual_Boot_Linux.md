> ## Dual_Boot_Ubuntu..

In this blog i will share my experience regarding dual boot Windows and Linux operating system.
So let's get started, Firstly when i am using windows on my device i am not completely able to use command line in commaand prompt it makes me uncomfortable, you also feel
uncomfortable when you switch from one operating system to another, The environment of that operating system may provide hindrance while using it, For me as well
when i installed ubuntu in my laptop, I felt discomfort because when i switched to ubuntu before a month i bought a game for windows sudenly i wish to play that computer games but i can't because
at that time i was using Linux Operating System and it's difficult me to play and do some task in ubuntu, So finally i decided to dual boot windows and ubuntu.

Dual booting linux is not so tough task you also can dual boot your computer or laptop , You only need bootable pen drive to dual boot
i had created partition on windows that how much space i wlll have to provide to ubuntu and installed ubuntu.

Now i am using dual boot Windows and Ubuntu to my Laptop, Some task that i can't do with ubuntu i can do it with windows and whenever i wish to play computer game i use windows.
So, As continuous using of ubuntu in my daily routine i loved using ubuntu and it's features, That made me fan of Linux Operating system.

From here i can access both windows as well as Linux...
